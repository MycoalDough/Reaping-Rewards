## 🎮 What is This?

Reaping Rewards is a cozy farming simulator where you learn real financial skills just by playing.  
Plant crops, harvest, trade, deploy robots, and navigate real-world money concepts (like *mortgage*, *supply and demand*, *bank loans*, *interest rates*, and more).  
If you don’t manage your finance well? Watch your mortgage payments rack up every 60 days… and see if you can keep up!
